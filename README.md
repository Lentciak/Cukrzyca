### About the report

We would like to invite you to read our report on the classification of patients with regard to the diagnosis of diabetes. Using [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data?select=diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv) from the Kaggle, we have prepared classification models and a study for selected statistical hypotheses.
